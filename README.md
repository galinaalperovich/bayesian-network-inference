# Learning with Bayesian netowrk 

In this project we have built and learned different Bayesian networks for car crash dataset. In general we have constructed 7 different networks with different modifications and improvements.

### Things are covered: 

* Data preparation

* BN structure learning with the use of chi-squared test (manual)

* BN structure learning with complete and incomplete observations

* BN improvement with MCMC and K2

* BN structure learning with MCMC and EM

* Inference ilustration

* In total 7 BNs with corresponding Log likelihood, BIC and Bayesian scores.
